    <h1> How Do Vehicle Features and Fuel Consumption Affect <br> CO2 Emissions in Passenger Vehicles?</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The transportation sector plays a big role in global CO2 emissions, which are a major factor in climate change. As countries work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is important to understand what affects CO2 emissions from vehicles. This dataset gives us a detailed look at vehicle features, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions over a span of several years, including various features of such vehicles.</p>

    <p>By examining this data, we aim to identify trends and correlations that could inform more sustainable vehicle design and consumer choices. The exploration of how fuel types, vehicle configurations, and fuel efficiency contribute to emissions is not only scientifically interesting but also essential for shaping policies that aim to reduce the environmental impact of personal transportation.</p>

    <h3>Data</h3>

    <p>The dataset used in the project captures detailed information on CO2 emissions from vehicles, sourced from the official open data website of the Canadian government. It covers emissions data for cars over a span of seven years. The dataset consists of 7,385 rows and 12 columns, where each row corresponds to a specific car model with different features, and the columns represent attributes such as vehicle type, fuel consumption, engine size, and so on. Here is an overview of our dataset:</p>

    <p>
        This chord diagram reveals the complex interrelationships between various vehicle characteristics and their impact on CO2 emissions. The strongest connections appear to be between Engine Size and CO2 emissions (shown by the thick red ribbons), indicating that larger engines generally correspond to higher emission levels. There's also a notable relationship between fuel consumption (both city and highway) and CO2 emissions, demonstrated by the substantial connections from the orange and purple segments. Vehicle Class shows moderate connections to both engine size and emissions, suggesting that certain vehicle categories tend to have larger engines and consequently higher emissions. The Fuel Type category appears to have thinner connections, indicating it may have a less direct influence on emissions compared to other factors. The extensive interconnections between fuel consumption metrics, engine size, and CO2 emissions highlight that these factors work together in determining a vehicle's environmental impact, with engine size appearing to be the most influential factor. This visualization effectively demonstrates that CO2 emissions are not determined by a single factor but rather by the complex interplay of multiple vehicle characteristics, with engine size and fuel consumption patterns being particularly significant determinants.
