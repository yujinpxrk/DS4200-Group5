For each of your visualizations, list the mark and channels for the figure, and discuss why you choose this type of visualization. If you have include color or interaction in the figure, you need to explain why including these can benefit the visualization (Any additional information you bring to the visualization):

Figure 3 - Bar chart: Average CO2 Emissions by Vehicle Class
Marks: The visualization uses bars to represent the average CO2 emissions for each vehicle class; each bar corresponds to a specific vehicle class.
Channels: The channels include length, position, and color. The length of the bars represents the magnitude of CO2 emissions for each vehicle class, allowing direct visual comparison. The position of the bars, determined by the x-axis and y-axis, plays a significant role: the x-axis encodes the categorical data and lists the vehicle classes, while the y-axis encodes the quantitative data of average CO2 emissions with a linear scale for accurate proportional comparisons. The bars also use height to represent emissions magnitude, while the uniform color eliminates distractions, ensuring focus remains on the data.
Design Choice: This bar chart design is ideal for comparing average CO2 emissions across multiple categories, as it visually emphasizes differences in magnitude. The consistent layout of the categories along the x-axis and the linear scaling of the y-axis make comparisons intuitive. The use of a single color minimizes distractions and enables quick assessments of which vehicle classes are the highest and lowest emitters. By choosing a bar chart, the design ensures clarity and accessibility for the audience.

Figure 4 - Scatter plot: CO2 Emissions vs Engine Size
Marks: The visualization uses points as the primary marks to represent individual data points. Each point corresponds to a specific combination of engine size and CO2 emissions. The density and distribution of the points provide insights into the relationship between the two variables.
Channels: The channels include position, size, and color. The position of the points along the x-axis encodes engine size, while the position along the y-axis encodes CO2 emissions, enabling an easy visual correlation between the two variables. The points are uniformly sized to ensure no additional encoding distracts from the relationship, and the use of a single color maintains visual clarity and focuses attention on the positional trends.
Design Choice: This scatter plot is an effective choice for showing the relationship between engine size and CO2 emissions, as it visually highlights patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. The linear scales on both axes allow viewers to interpret the data accurately, while the dense clustering of points at specific ranges reveals concentrations and possible trends. The use of uniform color and size ensures clarity, enabling the audience to focus on the correlation without unnecessary distractions. This design effectively communicates the increasing trend of CO2 emissions with larger engine sizes.

Figure 5 - Bar chart: Average CO2 Emissions by Fuel Type
Marks: The visualization uses rectangular bars to represent the average CO2 emissions for each fuel type.
Channels: The channels include length, position and color. The length of the bars encodes the magnitude of average CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer. The bars are also positioned along the y-axis, categorically labeled by fuel type, and the x-axis represents the numerical value of emissions. A uniform blue coloring is used to provide visual consistency across the bars, avoiding unnecessary distraction and keeping the focus on the length of the bars for comparison.
Design Choice: This bar graph format was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in comparing categorical data (fuel types) against a single numerical metric (average CO2 emissions). The horizontal layout provides ample room for labeling and ensures readability of fuel types. The consistent use of color avoids any misinterpretation and keeps the viewer’s attention on the bar lengths. 

Figure 6 - Bar chart: Average Fuel Consumption by Transmission Type
Marks: The visualization uses rectangular bars to represent the mean combined fuel consumption (L/100 km) for each transmission type.
Visual Channels::The channels include length, position and color. The length of the bars is used to represent the magnitude of mean fuel consumption values. Each bar is positioned along the x-axis, categorically labeled by transmission type, with the y-axis representing the numerical values of mean combined fuel consumption. Uniform blue coloring ensures visual coherence, allowing for easy comparison of fuel consumption across transmission types.
Design Choice: The bar graph is ideal for comparing mean combined fuel consumption across transmission types, as it clearly highlights differences. The vertical orientation aligns with standard readability, making the numerical trends intuitive to interpret. Consistent coloring allows the attention to be focused on the primary variable being compared without introducing color as an additional encoding.These design choices maximize on clarity and aim to create direct comparisons between categories, which is optimal categorical-numerical relationships.

Figure 7 - Interactive scatterplot: Combined Fuel Consumption vs CO2 Emissions
Marks: The visualization uses points to represent individual data points, where each points corresponds to a vehicle's fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
Visual Channels: The channels include position and opacity. The position of the points on the x-axis encodes fuel consumption in miles per gallon (mpg), while their position on the y-axis encodes CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer (g/km). The points are semi-transparent, allowing for better visibility in areas where data points overlap, which helps highlight patterns in dense regions of the plot.
Design Choice: This scatterplot format was chosen for its ability to effectively display the relationship between two continuous variables: fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The semi-transparent points mitigate the issue of overlapping points, making the visualization more informative. Interactive features, such as the slider for filtering by the number of cylinders and the dropdown menu for selecting vehicle makes, enhance user exploration and provide flexibility for focusing on specific data subsets.

Figure 8 - Interactive bar chart:  Average CO2 Emissions by Make
Marks: The visualization uses horizontal bars to represent the average CO2 emissions for different vehicle makes.
Visual Channels: The channels include length, position, and color. The length of the bars encodes the magnitude of average CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer (g/km). The bars are positioned along the y-axis, which is categorically labeled with vehicle makes, while the x-axis represents the numerical values of average CO2 emissions. A uniform blue color is applied to all bars to maintain visual consistency, minimize distractions, and emphasize the differences in bar lengths for comparison.
Design Choice: This horizontal bar chart format was chosen for its ability to clearly and effectively compare vehicle makes against average CO2 emission. The horizontal layout provides ample space for long category labels, ensuring readability and allowing easy identification of each make. The consistent use of color avoids any misinterpretation and keeps the viewer’s focus on the bar lengths, making the comparison intuitive and straightforward. Additionally, dropdown menus are included to allow users to filter and compare specific vehicle makes, adding interactivity and enhancing user engagement.

Figure 9 - Chord Diagram: Relationship of CO2 Emissions and Vehicle Features
Marks: The visualization uses circular sectors as primary marks and curved ribbons as connecting marks to show relationships between features.
Channels: The design employs three main channels: categorical colors to distinguish different vehicle features (purple, orange, green, red, blue), angular size to show relative importance, and position in the circular layout to organize relationships.
Design Choice: This Circular Network/Chord Diagram visualizes the complex relationships between vehicle features and CO2 emissions. The circular layout maximizes space efficiency while minimizing crossing lines, making it easier to trace connections between different features. The color coding aids with quick differentiation between feature categories. The implemented interactivity through tooltips enhances the visualization's utility by showing specific values and relationship strengths when users hover over different sections.
